# Tensorflow-projects
learning projects in tensorflow

These are project to Learn about Tensorflow, Neural Networks and CNN.

1st project is trained on mnist dataset from tensorflow.
  In this project, I learned about bacis of tensorflow and Neural Networks.

2nd project is trained on CIFER 10 dataset from tensorflow.
  In this project, I learned about convolution layer and max pooling layer in CNN.

3rd project is trained on cats_vs_dogs dataset.
  In this project, I learned how to get images from directories using tensorflow.
  How to evaluate model performance using matplotlib.
  And how to download data online.

4rth Project is trained on two datasets from kaggle
  1. Indian Food Images dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/indian-food-images-dataset)
  2. Food Classification dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bjoernjostein/food-classification)
  
  In starting I made two dataframe on each dataset and learned how to preprocess the directories and files in python using os,
  but then the issue I was facing was how to combine those datsets so I manually merge those datasets.
  
  After merging I loaded data for model to train abd made an architecture for model.
  
  unfortunately the model's accuracy is abnormal going above 100%
